# Snips-Kalender
A calendar info-app for Snips.ai

## Installation

**Important:** The following instructions assume that [Snips](https://snips.gitbook.io/documentation/snips-basics) is
already configured and running on your device. [SAM](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation) should
also already be set up and connected to your device and your account.

1. In the German [app store](https://console.snips.ai/) add the
app `Spritpreise` to your *German* assistant.

2. If you already have the same assistant on your platform, update it
(with [Sam](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation)) with:
      ```bash
      sam update-assistant
      ```

   Otherwise install the assistant on the platform with [Sam](https://snips.gitbook.io/getting-started/installation)
   with the following command to choose it (if you have multiple assistants in your Snips console):
      ```bash
      sam install assistant
      ```
That's it!

## Usage

With this app you can ask Snips for information about the current fuel price of your favourite gas station.
